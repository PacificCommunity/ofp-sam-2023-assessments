4 regions
Empty recruitment regions
46% of the biomass in the North and South

Catch conditioning
Hessian

Growth
Estimated internally
Richards curve

Various model changes
Don't estimate reporting rate for groups with 0 recoveries
Initial F starts at 0, instead of average of first 5 years

Regional recruitment penalty
Forces the model to have somewhat similar rec pattern between regions

(Not happening: Length-based selectivity)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth
New CPUE approach
Length Comp sample sizes
CPUE CV
Lorenzen M
Alternative movement
Alternative recruitment
New fishery groupings
Dirichlet multinomial

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other ideas:
Single movement rate across all quarters
Test sensitivities to movement priors
