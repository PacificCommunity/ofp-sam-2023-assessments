YFT work plan [22 Dec, future]

 2  CPUE: time of day, regional scaling
 3  Tags: enforce 92 days, attrition curve similar to raw data
 4  Input: M, estimate externally from tags, likelihood profile
 5  Selectivity: compare with fixed growth model, node for age class 3
 6  Growth: reconsider two-phase growth (kink) if it fits better, oto vs tag
 7  Size comps: convert weight comps to length comps to see if mismatch
 8  Data conflict: size comps may have too much influence in MFCL
 9 Simplify model: until Hessian is positive definite, single movement rate
    across quarters, orthogonal recruitment, catch conditioning, combine regions
    1+2, 3+4, 5+6, track Hessian for all models
10  Other: starting values for recruitment proportions, estimate recruitment
    proportions in later phases
