1. Equatorial model
Rob Campbell, Nicholas
This could be implemented in MFCL using 3 regions: IDPH, Archipelago, 3&4
The short time window between full data update and SC is an issue

2. Model without tags
Simon Hoyle, John Hampton
More than an interesting sensitivity run, could be used in the grid
Especially viable when using Inna's SEAPODYM movement coefficients
