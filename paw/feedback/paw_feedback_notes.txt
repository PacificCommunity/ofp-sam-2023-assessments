1. Equatorial model
Rob Campbell, Nicholas
This could be implemented in MFCL using 3 regions: IDPH, Archipelago, 3&4
The short time window between full data update and SC is an issue

2. Model without tags
Simon Hoyle, John Hampton
More than an interesting sensitivity run, could be used in the grid
Especially viable when using Inna's SEAPODYM movement coefficients

3. Why not use both lenth and weight data from LL fisheries?
Mark Maunder
Mark's point is that you can use both, unless we have W->L conversion problem
John Hampton and Simon Hoyle: the weight comps data collection was sourced to the
commercial fleet, which collects a large amount of data that are representative
of the catch composition
John Hampton and Simon Hoyle: the length comps data collection, on the other
hand, is limited to a small number of training vessels and similar exercises,
which is not representative of the catch composition
