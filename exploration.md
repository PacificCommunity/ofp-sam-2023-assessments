# Exploratory Model Runs

## Stepwise and exploratory runs

1. Diag2020
2. NewExe
3. CatchCond
4. Initial tweaks
5. Rep rate tweaks
6. Four regions
7. New fishery groupings
8. New CPUE approach
9. New input sample sizes
10. Movement
11. Dirichlet
12. Add new data
13. Tag mixing
14. Richards growth

See recommendations from panel.

Alternative movement scenarios that have been mentioned include (a) age-specific
and (b) fixed movement coefficients, e.g. from Seapodym.

The tagging data will be processed in the way Matt did, enforcing a minimum
number of days at liberty.

Larger regions may require longer tag mixing periods.

CPUE scenarios that can be considered include (a) viable habitats and (b)
spatially disaggregated. We'll communicate our explorations and findings with
Mark Maunder.

Fisheries can be combined or separated and selectivity parameters can be shared.

Regional structures to consider are 1, 4, 8, and 9 regions.

## Diagnostics

* Likelihood components
* Positive definite Hessian
* Maximum gradients
