# Peer Review Panel Comments on Model Complexity

The string 'complex' occurs 24 times.

There is a dedicated section B.5:

## B.5 Model complexity

**Too little time**

The extent of data and model complexity requires more time and attention than
can be afforded via WCPFC's SC process.

**Path to simpler models**

After SPC develops a conceptual model and conducts a regression tree analysis of
length-composition data, the Panel expects that simpler models will result from
this process.

**Region 9**

There seems little basis for separating region 9 for this assessment.

**Conceptual model**

The results of the conceptual model to identify "realism constraints" and
expected model behavior.

**No recruitment in some regions**

Consideration should be given to in which regions recruitment should be
expected. The current result that there is no recruitment to region 8 seems
implausible a priori, but earlier assessments had zero recruitment in other
regions.

**Assessing the appropriate level of model complexity**

The Hessian matrix should be explored to assess not just the variances of the
parameter estimates and the derived variables, but also which parameters may be
confounded.

**Equatorial model**

Consider a model based on data for only the equatorial areas (regions 3,4,7,8)
modelled as a single area and compare its results with an equivalently
parameterized Stock Synthesis model. The model would be structured as
"fleets-as-areas".

**Age-specific movement**

Allow juvenile movement rates to differ from those for adults.
